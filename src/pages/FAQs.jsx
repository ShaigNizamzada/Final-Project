          <h4>1. License</h4>
          <p>
            The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you
            forgot to shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to
            impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily
            bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframes—will your clients accept
            that you go about things the facile way?
          </p>
          <h4>2. Ownership</h4>
          <p>
            Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain terms that
            Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever. Not so
            fast, I’d say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking
            text, as its use is merely the symptom of a worse problem to take
            into consideration.
          </p>
          <h4>3. User Content</h4>
          <p>
            You begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel away
            what’s not needed, you come to the point, make things clear, add
            value, you’re a content person, you like words. Design is no
            afterthought, far from it, but it comes in a deserved second.
            Anyway, you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always
            have a place in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not
            always the way you like it, not always in the preferred order.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Fees and Purchase Terms</h4>
          <p>
            Even if your less into design and more into content strategy you may
            find some redeeming value with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less.
            You made all the required mock ups for commissioned layout, got all
            the approvals, built a tested code base or had them built, you
            decided on a content management system, got a license for it or
            adapted open source software for your client’s needs. Then the
            question arises: where’s the content.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Updates to The Service</h4>
          <p>
            That’s not so bad, there’s dummy copy to the rescue. But worse, what
            if the fish doesn’t fit in the can, the foot’s to big for the boot?
            Or to small? To short sentences, to many headings, images too large
            for the proposed design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks
            iffy for reasons the folks in the meeting can’t quite tell right
            now, but they’re unhappy, somehow. A client that’s unhappy for a
            reason is a problem, a client that’s unhappy though he or her can’t
            quite put a finger on it is worse.
          </p>
          <h4>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h4>
          <p>
            Chances are there wasn’t collaboration, communication, and
            checkpoints, there wasn’t a process agreed upon or specified with
            the granularity required. It’s content strategy gone awry right from
            the start. Forswearing the use of Lorem Ipsum wouldn’t have helped,
            won’t help now. It’s like saying you’re a bad designer, use less
            bold text, don’t use italics in every other paragraph. True enough,
            but that’s not all that it takes to get things back on track.
